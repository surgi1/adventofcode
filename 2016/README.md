# Advent of Code 2016

Set of 2016 was also a great one, with a number of tasks residing around graph traversing algorithms, where the real question is to figure out the criteria for path reduction.

Solutions for days 1 and 2 were not archived.

## Highlights

Puzzles with exceptional entertainment value and/or unconventional thinking necessary fit the highlights for me. Usually the most fun/challenging experience is hidden in Part 2 of the puzzle.
