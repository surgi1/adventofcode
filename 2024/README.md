# Advent of Code 2024

Rather easy set of puzzles for AoC standards, with couple outstanding pieces in it.

## Highlights

Puzzles with exceptional entertainment value and/or unconventional thinking necessary fit the highlights for me. Usually the most fun/challenging experience is hidden in Part 2 of the puzzle.

* [Day 15: Warehouse Woes](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/15) - [code](https://github.com/surgi1/adventofcode/tree/main/2024/day15) - [live](https://surgi1.github.io/adventofcode/2024/day15/index.anim.html) - cool little warehouse reorganizing robot! Sleek visuals!
* [Day 21: Keypad Conundrum](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/21) - [code](https://github.com/surgi1/adventofcode/tree/main/2024/day21) - Yo Dawg! Heard you like to control robots, so we put robots in charge of controlling robots, so you can control robots while controlling robots!
* [Day 24: Crossed Wires](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/24) - [code](https://github.com/surgi1/adventofcode/tree/main/2024/day24) - It always feels awesome to solve puzzle by hand!
