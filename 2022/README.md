# Advent of Code 2022

Puzzles of 2022's set maintained difficulty roughly similar to the previous year, making it another great set of sometimes innovative and most of times fun challenges!

## Highlights

Puzzles with exceptional entertainment value and/or unconventional thinking necessary fit the highlights for me. Usually the most fun/challenging experience is hidden in Part 2 of the puzzle.
