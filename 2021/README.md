# Advent of Code 2021

Puzzles of 2021 were considerably more difficult than 2020's ones. Lots of hard and/or innovative tasks, mainly in its second half. Sometimes even a specialised knowledge (such as 3d transformations) was a pre-requisite to solving them. Overall a great and challenging set of puzzles.

## Highlights

Puzzles with exceptional entertainment value and/or unconventional thinking necessary fit the highlights for me. Usually the most fun/challenging experience is hidden in Part 2 of the puzzle.
