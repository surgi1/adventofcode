# Advent of Code 2017

Puzzles of AoC 2017 are a bit harder than 2016's, still not reaching the difficulty of the later years. Few of them required some out-of-the-box thinking, making it a very enjoyable set altogether.

The AoC 2017 calendar visualization, however, is pure gold.

Solutions for days 1 and 2 were not archived.

## Highlights

Puzzles with exceptional entertainment value and/or unconventional thinking necessary fit the highlights for me. Usually the most fun/challenging experience is hidden in Part 2 of the puzzle.
