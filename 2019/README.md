# Advent of Code 2019

[https://adventofcode.com/2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019)

Puzzles of 2019's AoC resided around the Intcode Computer, a software emulation of an actual computer attendees had to create, extend and maintain (a Virtual Machine, if you will). As attendees progressed through the puzzles, the Computer started to communicate in ASCII, organize arrays of itself into a network, play a bunch of games or control a number of peripherals. This, and the way it was presented, resembles the single most memorable AoC experience for me.

As for the whole set, the year of 2019 was very challenging, some advanced math and out of the box thinking was mandatory in more than a handful of puzzles.

After 2018's set, this deserves another standing ovations to the author.

## Highlights

Puzzles with exceptional entertainment value and/or unconventional thinking necessary fit the highlights for me. Usually the most fun/challenging experience is hidden in Part 2 of the puzzle.
